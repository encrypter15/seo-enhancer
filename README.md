# xAI SEO Enhancer

A WordPress plugin that leverages xAI to enhance posts and pages for superior SEO performance. Compatible with Rank Math, Yoast SEO, or as a standalone tool with its own scoring system.

## Features
- **SEO Analysis**: Uses xAI to analyze content and suggest improvements for focus keywords, SEO titles, meta descriptions, and content structure.
- **SEO Scoring**: Provides a persistent score (X/100) with detailed checks for keyword frequency, density, title/meta presence, and content length, visible on page load.
- **Image Generation**: Integrates xAIâ€™s image generation API with a popup for creating featured or inline images, triggered manually with user prompt options.
- **Auto-Fix**: Checkbox option to automatically apply non-image suggestions after analysis.
- **Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates with Rank Math, Yoast SEO, or operates standalone with custom meta fields.
- **Dashboard**: Dedicated settings page with styled API key status and xAI service status updates, featuring clear visual indicators.

## Installation
1. Download the plugin files:
   - `xai-seo-enhancer.php`
   - `xai-optimizer.js`
   - `settings.php`
   - `settings.css`
2. Upload the `xai-seo-enhancer` folder to `wp-content/plugins/`.
3. Activate the plugin via the WordPress admin panel under "Plugins".
4. Configure the xAI API key in the "xAI SEO Enhancer" menu in the WordPress sidebar.

## Requirements
- WordPress 5.0 or higher
- PHP 7.2 or higher
- An xAI API key with access to chat completions and image generation (see [xAI Docs](https://docs.x.ai))

## Usage
1. **Settings**:
   - Navigate to "xAI SEO Enhancer" in the sidebar.
   - Enter your xAI API key and save.
   - View API key status and xAI service status on the dashboard.

2. **Post/Page Editing**:
   - Open a post or page in the editor.
   - Find the "xAI SEO Enhancer" metabox in the sidebar.
   - View the initial SEO score and checks on page load.
   - Click "Analyze with xAI" to fetch suggestions without saving or reloading.
   - Apply individual suggestions via buttons or enable "Auto-Fix" checkbox for non-image changes.
   - Click "Generate Image" to create an image, preview it in a popup, and choose to set as featured or insert into the post.

3. **Retesting**:
   - After applying changes, click "Retest" to refresh the score and suggestions.

## Troubleshooting
- **No Initial Score**: Ensure PHP debug is enabled (`WP_DEBUG` in `wp-config.php`) and check logs.
- **Image Creation Fails**: Verify your xAI API key has image generation permissions; check `debug.log` for errors.
- **Suggestions Not Applying**: Clear caches (browser and server) and ensure admin permissions.
